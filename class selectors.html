    <p class=" national">Cybercriminals forged the signature of Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on a
    fabricated arrest warrant to deceive a 62-year-old retired LIC officer from Pune and extort nearly Rs 99 lakh from
    her in a “digital arrest” scam.

    According to the Pune City Cyber Police, the fraud began in the last week of October when the woman, a resident of
    Kothrud, received a call from a man claiming to represent a “Data Protection Agency.” He alleged that her
    Aadhaar-linked mobile number had been misused for fraudulent transactions.
    </p>
    <p class="national">Investigators have begun tracing the bank accounts and phone numbers used in the fraud.
        Officials said scammers increasingly misuse names of real and fictitious government agencies, such as the Data
        Protection Board of India (DPBI) and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), to create credibility.

        Deputy Commissioner of Police (Cyber) said that the use of forged documents carrying signatures of senior
        ministers and top officials represents a concerning trend. “These scams exploit public trust in official
        institutions. Citizens should verify any such communication directly with authorities before taking financial
        action,” the official said.

    <p class="national">Security checks were intensified across Uttar Pradesh on 11 November, a day after the Delhi car blast near the
        Red Fort that killed at least 13 people and injured more than two dozen.

        Anti-terror agencies and police teams carried out searches in several cities, including state capital Lucknow,
        where a joint team of the ATS (Anti-Terrorist Squad), Lucknow Police and Central agencies raided the Muttaqipur
        residence of Dr Shaheen Shahid, earlier arrested in connection with the Delhi blast.

        Officials collected documents and questioned her family members and neighbours to trace her background, sources
        said. Her father Syed Ahmad Ansari said he was “shocked to hear of her alleged involvement”.
    </p>
    <p class="national">Police sources said Shahid is believed to have links with Dr Muzammil, from whose possession a large quantity of
        explosives was earlier seized in Faridabad. Muzammil is wanted by Jammu & Kashmir Police in a separate case
        related to a social media post allegedly supporting the banned organisation Jaish-e-Mohammed.

        Following the blast, security arrangements were tightened across Uttar Pradesh, with police conducting checking
        drives at crowded markets, Metro stations, shopping malls, railway stations and bus terminals. Bomb disposal and
        canine squads were also deployed at sensitive locations.

    <h4 class="sports">The high-profile Ravindra Jadeja–Sanju Samson trade has reportedly stalled, with Rajasthan Royals facing
        overseas quota and budget constraints. The deal, which could also involve Sam Curran, may only proceed after the
        IPL retention deadline on November 15.

    <p class="sports">The much-anticipated Ravindra Jadeja–Sanju Samson trade between Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and Rajasthan Royals
        (RR) has hit a snag, with the deal yet to be formally submitted to the Board of Control for Cricket in India
        (BCCI) for approval. According to a Cricbuzz report, procedural and financial complications have delayed the
        move, despite both franchises having already expressed interest.

    </p>
    <p class="sports">The main reason for the holdup is reportedly the involvement of Sam Curran, the England all-rounder, as part of
        the trade discussions. The Royals’ overseas quota is already full, which prevents them from adding Curran unless
        they release one of their current foreign players.
        As things stand, Rajasthan’s squad includes eight overseas cricketers — Jofra Archer, Shimron Hetmyer, Wanindu
        Hasaranga, Maheesh Theekshana, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Kwena Maphaka, Nandre Burger, and Lhuan-dre Pretorius — along
        with 14 Indian players. This gives them space for three more signings within the 25-player limit, but they also
        need to remain within their budget cap.

    <h4 class="sports">Two-time Olympic medallist PV Sindhu, 30, confirmed on Monday that she was ending her season early. Sindhu, who
        reached the quarterfinal of the World Championships in August, has been recovering from a foot injury.

    <p class="sports">Two-time Olympic medallist PV Sindhu announced on Monday that she is ending her 2025 season early due to a foot
        injury. Sindhu has not competed on the tour since September, when she reached the quarter-final of the China
        Masters Super 750 tournament.

        Sindhu took to social media on Monday to confirm that she has yet to recover from the foot injury she sustained
        before the European leg of the tour. Her medical team has advised her to take an extended period of rest to
        recover fully from the latest setback. Sindhu has missed several major tournaments over the past two months,
        including the Arctic Open, Denmark Open, and French Open.
    </p>
    <p class="sports">This is the third time in four years that Sindhu has ended her season early because of injury concerns. The
        stress fracture she suffered at the 2022 Commonwealth Games was her first major setback, and it had a cascading
        effect on her form in the following seasons."After consulting closely with my team and with the guidance of the
        incredible Dr Pardiwala, we felt it was best for me to withdraw from all remaining BWF Tour events in 2025,"
        Sindhu said in a post on X.
